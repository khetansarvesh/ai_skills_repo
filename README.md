## 🗺️ Which Agent Should I Use?

Not sure where to start? Use this quick reference:

| I want to...                  | Use this command          | Agent used           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Plan a new feature            | `/plan`                   | planner              |
| Design system architecture    | `/plan` + architect agent | architect            |
| Write code with tests first   | `/tdd`                    | tdd-guide            |
| Review code I just wrote      | `/code-review`            | code-reviewer        |
| Fix a failing build           | `/build-fix`              | build-error-resolver |
| Run end-to-end tests          | `/e2e`                    | e2e-runner           |

### Common Workflows

**Starting a new feature:**

```
/everything-claude-code:plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
                                              → planner creates implementation blueprint
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide enforces write-tests-first
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer checks your work
```

**Fixing a bug:**

```
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide: write a failing test that reproduces it
                                              → implement the fix, verify test passes
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer: catch regressions
```

**Preparing for production:**

```
/security-scan                                → security-reviewer: OWASP Top 10 audit
/e2e                                          → e2e-runner: critical user flow tests
/test-coverage                                → verify 80%+ coverage
```

## Note on Tools and MCPs

My context window is shrinking / Claude is running out of context

- Cause : Too many MCP servers eat your context. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.
- Fix: Disable unused MCPs per project:

```json
// In your project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "disabledMcpServers": ["supabase", "railway", "vercel"]
}
```

Keep under 10 MCPs enabled and under 80 tools active.
